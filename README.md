MachineLearningToolkit
======================

Machine learning toolkit is an Android library that enables local 
machine learning computations on the phone. The library preserves 
the state of a learner over the application lifecycle. I.e. it allows
saving the state on a persistent file, and loading it once the application
restarts. It also allows external file loading, thus enables learner
sharing among multiple devices.
